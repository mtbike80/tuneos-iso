Periodic fstrim for SSD disks
-----------------------------

fstrim(8) is used on a mounted filesystem to discard blocks which are not in
use by the filesystem. This is useful in particular for solid-state drives
(SSDs).

A systemd service and matching timer is available to periodically perform
fstrim on relevant filesystems. On new installations, it is enabled by
default. To enable it on installations upgraded from before 2.35.1-2, run
the following as root:

    systemctl enable fstrim.timer
